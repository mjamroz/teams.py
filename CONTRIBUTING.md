## Multi-Language SDK

The Teams SDK is maintained across three languages: **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **.NET**. When proposing new features, please discuss them in a language-agnostic way in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-sdk/discussions). This ensures that features can be implemented consistently across all three SDKs and benefits the entire Teams developer community.
