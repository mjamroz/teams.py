# BotBuilder example

This example showcases the BotBuilder plugin which can be used to systematically transition projects from BotBuilder based projects to TeamsSDK projects.
It features a BotBuilder app (using a CloudAdapter), and a TeamsSDK app.
Upon sending a message, both the BotBuilder app AND the TeamsSDK app receive the notification, and are able to reply to the user.

Take a look at the [guide](https://microsoft.github.io/teams-sdk/python/migrations/botbuilder/) for more details.
